# BCG_DataScience_AdvancedAnalytics_Virtual_Internship

This virtual internship shows what it’s like to work at BCG GAMMA. There are basically four modules they are Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering & Modelling and Findings & Recommendations. 

# PowerCo Churn Analysis Project

## Project Overview

PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility, is facing customer churn, To diagnose the source of customer churn, PowerCo has partnered with BCG. One of the key hypotheses is that churn is driven by customer price sensitivity, and the team aims to predict churn using data-driven models. I have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities. 

This README provides an overview of the project's tasks and objectives.

## Task 1: Business Understanding & Problem Framing

**Objective**: Understand the client's challenges and formulate a hypothesis about churn being driven by price sensitivity. Outline the major steps to test this hypothesis.

**Details**: In this task, we delve into PowerCo's situation and define the problem. We lay the foundation for our analysis by formulating a hypothesis and designing an approach to test it. We communicate our thoughts to the Lead Data Scientist (LDS) to guide the project's direction.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning

**Objective**: Prepare the data for analysis by addressing issues like missing values, duplicates, data type conversions, and outliers. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights.

**Details**: In this task, we work with historical customer data, pricing data, and churn indicators. We ensure data quality by cleaning the datasets. EDA helps us understand the data's characteristics, identify trends, and visualize key parameters.

## Task 3: Feature Engineering

**Objective**: Identify potential drivers of churn and engineer features that can inform our churn model.

**Details**: We brainstorm and build features using the cleaned data. These features will serve as inputs to our predictive model. We focus on uncovering signals in the data that could explain churn behavior among PowerCo's customers.

## Task 4: Modeling & Evaluation

**Objective**: Build predictive churn models, evaluate their performance, and assess the impact of a 20% discount strategy on high-churn propensity customers.

**Details**: We construct churn prediction models, employing the features generated in the previous task. Model evaluation using a holdout dataset helps us select the best-performing model. We also consider the effectiveness of a 20% discount strategy on customers likely to churn.

## Task 5: Insights & Recommendation

**Objective**: Draft an executive summary of project findings and recommendations for the steering committee meeting.

**Details**: We summarize all project findings in an executive summary slide. This presentation is crucial for communicating our insights and recommendations to stakeholders, including the head of the SME division.
